### 2. Microservices Components

#### 2.1. Next.js Web Application (apps/web)

The frontend application built with Next.js 15 using the App Router, providing:

- Server components for improved performance
- Client components for interactive features
- API routes for backend functionality
- Integration with Supabase and Vercel AI SDK

#### 2.2. Shared UI Components (packages/ui)

A library of reusable UI components built with Shadcn UI:

- Consistent design language across the application
- Customizable color system
- Accessible and responsive components
- Type-safe component props with TypeScript

#### 2.3. Database Layer (packages/database)

Manages database interactions using Prisma ORM:

- Type-safe database queries
- Schema definition and migrations
- Database seeding utilities
- Integration with Supabase PostgreSQL

#### 2.4. AI Service (packages/ai)

Encapsulates AI functionality using Vercel AI SDK:

- Specialized agent definitions
- Prompt engineering utilities
- Tool integrations for agents
- Streaming response handling

#### 2.5. Configuration (packages/config)

Shared configuration for consistent development:

- ESLint configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- Prettier configuration
- Build and bundling settings

```

### 4. Key Features

#### 4.1. Modular Agent System

The AI coding team is structured as composable, specialized agents:

- Each agent is a separate module with well-defined responsibilities
- Agents can be easily composed for complex tasks
- New agent types can be added without modifying existing ones
- Shared utilities for common agent tasks

#### 4.2. Real-time Collaboration

Built-in support for real-time collaboration using Supabase Realtime:

- Presence indicators showing active users
- Real-time updates of code changes
- Collaborative editing capabilities
- Event broadcasting for system notifications

#### 4.3. Persistent Storage

Integrated storage solution with Supabase Storage:

- Code artifact storage
- Project resource management
- Versioning support
- Access control integration with authentication

#### 4.4. Authentication and Authorization

Comprehensive user management with Supabase Auth:

- Multiple authentication methods (email, social, etc.)
- Role-based access control
- Fine-grained permissions
- JWT token management

#### 4.5. Type Safety

End-to-end type safety across the entire application:

- TypeScript for frontend and backend code
- Zod for runtime validation
- Prisma for type-safe database queries
- Type-safe API routes and client calls

## Example Implementation

Below is a simplified example of how the AI agent system would be implemented:

```typescript
// packages/ai/src/agents/index.ts
import { createAI, createStreamableUI } from 'ai/rsc';
import { openai } from '@/lib/openai';
import { SpecializedAgent } from './specialized-agent';
import { createAgentRegistry } from './registry';

export const aiAgents = createAI({
  actions: {
    submitQuery: async (query: string, context: any) => {
      const agentRegistry = createAgentRegistry();
      const currentAgent = agentRegistry.getDefaultAgent();
      
      // Process the query with the current agent
      const response = await currentAgent.processQuery(query, context);
      
      // Check for handoff conditions
      const handoffAgent = currentAgent.checkForHandoff(response);
      if (handoffAgent) {
        // Perform handoff to specialized agent
        return handoffAgent.processQuery(query, {...context, handoffContext: response});
      }
      
      return createStreamableUI(
        <div className="agent-response">
          {response}
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

This microservices architecture provides a flexible, scalable foundation for deploying the AI coding team's output as a complete package. By leveraging modern technologies like Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, Shadcn UI, Prisma ORM, and Supabase, the system offers a powerful yet developer-friendly experience that can be easily extended and integrated into existing projects.

The modular nature of the architecture allows for easy customization and extension, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in the construction technology domain and beyond.
